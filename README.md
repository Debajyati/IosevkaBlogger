# IosevkaBlogger

My Custom Iosevka Font Family to be used as the font face for my tech blogs (in hashnode).

I generated these fonts by following the instructions available in the [Iosevka Project documentation](https://github.com/be5invis/Iosevka/blob/main/doc/custom-build.md#customized-build).

Manually patched Nerd Fonts of this font family available in the release.
